# Dynamic-sorting

The program will first read in some employee data from a file named "p1data", creates a dynamically allocated employee record object for each employee, with its address stored in the next position in a dynamically allocated pointer array data structure. A copy of the array is then made and manipulated to provide a sorted view of the data in increasing order of the employee ID. The a second and different sorted view of the data is made, this time by employee salary. The sorting involves moving the pointers around, rather than the corresponding records.
